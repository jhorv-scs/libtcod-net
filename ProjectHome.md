This library is a thin c# wrapper around BSD licensed libtcod (http://doryen.eptalys.net/). It provides a cross platform graphics and roguelike library to those who wish to program in c#.

Using the magic of SWIG, the c# wrappers are now built into an official release of libtcod, and thus this external project's time has come to an end. Please use the libtcod-net found here:

I'm keeping this project open for awhile just in case people need the old version for some reason.
